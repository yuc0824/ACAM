\usage{
ACAM_cluster(DF, threshold = 4000, SEED = 123)
}
\arguments{
\item{DF}{The input dataset. Make sure that the dataset is lognormalized. Note that the rows are cells, and the columns are marker genes.}

\item{threshold}{The threshold that any dataset with the sample size larger than this threshold should be used an accelerated clustering procedure. Default is 4000.}

\item{SEED}{The random seed.}
