\arguments{
\item{DF}{The input dataset. Make sure that the dataset is lognormalized. Note that the rows are cells, and the columns are marker genes.}

\item{preprocess}{Whether the dataset need to be preprocessed. If true, DF will be lognormalized and zero expressed genes will be removed. Default is TRUE.}

\item{cluster_results}{The clustering results obtained from the function \code{ACAM_cluster}}

\item{gene.markers}{The species- and tissue-specific marker genes obtained from CellMatch database.}

\item{k.neighbors}{The number of neighbors considered in the final step kNN.}

\item{min_num}{The mininum number which any clusters have a larger size than this number will be considered as representative clusters. Default is 10.}

\item{pca}{Whether PCA should be used in the dimension reduction.}

\item{pca.rank}{The dimension of which the dataset will be reduced into by the method PCA.}

\item{umap.rank}{The dimension of which the dataset will be reduced into by the method umap.}

\item{umap.seed}{The random seed when conducting UMAP.}

\item{knn.seed}{The random seed when conducting kNN.}
}
\value{
The annotation results \code{annotation_results}.
